Define the period of the short-term moving average (e.g. 20-day) and the long-term moving average (e.g. 50-day).

Calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages using historical price data.
Determine the current price of the cryptocurrency being traded.

Compare the short-term and long-term moving averages to identify whether to generate a buy or sell signal:

If the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average and the current price is above the short-term moving average, generate a buy signal.

If the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average and the current price is below the short-term moving average, generate a sell signal.

Place a buy or sell order based on the signal generated in step 4.
